# ReplitGPT (chat-gpt-replit)

ReplitGPT is a Greasemonkey script (and in the future a firefox and chrome extension) that can open code blocks generated by chatGPT in Replit for easy running and modificatin.

**Tested only on Firefox on MacOS and Linux.**

## Features

1) Copy code over from ChatGPT to Replit
2) Ignore code blocks that aren't runnable in Replit (i.e. shell commands) (works sometimes)

## How to use?

1) Install the Greasemonkey extension in your browser
2) Create a new user script
3) Paste contents of ReplitGPT.js into script and save it
4) Try it out!

## Known Issues

1) Java code may be parsed as C# code. This is due to ChatGPT annotating the code block as `language-csharp` whenever it outputs Java code, likely due to the 2 languages being similar.
2) When copying code from GPT by using the 'Copy Code' button, the Copied confirmation will swap spaces with the 'Open in Replit' button (just swapping the button's order from the getgo by prepending the add to replit button to the actionbar is probably the easiest sol)
3) Doesn't work if user isn't logged into Replit

## How does it work?

It monitors for code blocks on ChatGPT, when a new one appears, it adds a button that lets you open it in Replit. When you click the button, the code is encoded into Base64 and then passed via the uri to Replit.
When you land on the /new/ page of Replit, it extracts the code from the uri and puts it into SessionStorage. Then, when you get to the editor, it overwrites the contents of the editor
with the code stored in sessionStorage
